# Open notification protocol

# Why a notification protocol?

ðŸ˜  **Abuse of email and other communication channels for notifications.** 
Email is meant for communication, not to deliver notifications. Email overload is worsened by notifications piggybacking email.

ðŸ˜ž **Lack of interoperable notification delivery mechanism.**
There is no foolproof way for services to deliver notifications to a user, when the user is off their app/website/platform. Communication channels like email/SMS are abused as fallback.

ðŸ¤© **Make notifications useful again.** 
Potential to synchronise `on platform` and `off platform` notifications, reducing notification overload. Both users and notification publishers benefit from using a better channel optimised for notifications.

# Notification v/s communication

Notification is also a form of communication. So how should one decide when to treat something as either communication or a notification?

> **If something is treated as notification on your app/website/platform, treat it as a notification off your platform as well. Don't offload it on to a communication channel.**

# Architecture [WIP]
- User identification with email address

## Notification publishers
- Publishers send notifications as webhooks to `https://email-domain.com/onp-notifications/email-username`

## Notification subscribers
- Subscribers send read receipts as webhooks to `https://publisher-domain.com/onp-receipts/email-username`

## Notification spec
- Likely to follow Android notification spec
- Buttons with OS specific URIs
